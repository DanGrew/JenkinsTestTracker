Description, "Resolved issue found where Jenkins provides a "null" for an array which is interpreted as a value, instead it is now ignored. This occured when a new job was created without any completed or running builds. Also resolved an issue where MediaPlayers might be being garbage collected which caused the sound to be cut off almost randomly. This has been resolved by waiting for each sound to complete then dereferencing it. Thanks to Rory O'Mahony for the research."

Description, "Resolved Build result not updating if constantly building - issue #206. The build result from the last completed build will be used to fill in the missing state update.

Description, "The build wall now provides some basic statistics at the top of the wall (number of jobs passing, number of tests passing, nodes in use, time since last build). There is currently no configuration for these statistics, but that will be coming soon. There was issue found with the optimised job details importing causing failures not to be notified correctly - the mechanism has been rewritten to address the problem."
